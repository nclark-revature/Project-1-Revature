Title of the Project
Project 1


Explanation and Overview
Tasked with creating a compelling experience from a business previously explored, collaborated in an agile environment to create unique individual features leveraging visualforce based on that business.
These are then surfaced through the use of experience cloud to create a customer or partner experience site that allows for the use of these new features.
The Seven Stones Salesforce org was created for the sales of apartment units or single family houses. For that we created 4 custom objects, outlined below.

Custom Objects:
Apartment__c
Client__c
Customer__c
Property__c

Custom Object Relationships:
Master-detail relationship between Apartment (parent) and Properties(child).
Lookup relationship between Properties and Customers, and Properties and Clients.

Project 1 can be utilized as a customer and partner facing site to access, display, and modify property listings for a real estate business.
Partner and Customer-facing site on Experience Cloud with the following custom Visualforce page functionalities:
Search Available Properties
Add new Apartments, with Properties option

Getting Started / Set-Up
As this project utilizes Apex, it will need to be compiled and executed on the Salesforce server platform. This can be done by using the developer console when logged into an org on salesforce.com, or by installing Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code.
Once the extensions are installed, clone this repository and open the folder in your VS Code. In order to utilize functionality, first ensure that the extensions have loaded and use View > Command Palette or Ctrl+Shift+P.
Type "authorize" to select "SFDX: Authorize an Org", and connect the project to your desired org.
Before deploying the manifest to the org, follow the following steps to ensure your org will deploy with no errors:

From your target org, copy your admin user username (in email format) and paste replace "THISTEXT" in the following files with that username:

Apartment__c.workflow-meta.xml
Customer__c.workflow-meta.xml
Property__c.workflow-meta.xml
Seven_Stones.site-meta.xml

After saving, you should be able to right-click the manifest and deploy to the target org.
